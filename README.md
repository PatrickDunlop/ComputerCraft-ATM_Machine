# ComputerCraft-ATM

The purpose of this project is to create an ATM machine, using a computer in the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft.
The ATM machine will be able to create a personal account, and in said account, will allow the user to deposit and withdraw money (who's currency is in Bench Dollars) and will allow the user to edit their account details and check their balance.
